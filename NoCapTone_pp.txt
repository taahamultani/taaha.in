Privacy Policy for NoCapTone

Effective Date: 18th August

At NoCapTone, we believe your words should sound cooler, not creepier. That means we respect your privacy and aren’t in the business of selling your secrets to shady data lords.

Information We Collect
- Text Input: The stuff you type in for conversion. We process it to give you the requested output. Unless you’re saving history (if/when that’s a feature), we don’t keep it.
- Usage Data: Boring, non-personal things like device type, crash logs, and anonymous analytics so we can keep the app running instead of crashing every 5 minutes.
- Account Info: If you create an account, we’ll have basic details like your email or username so you can actually log in.

How We Use Your Information
- To make your text sound like a corporate boss, a boomer, or uwu anime fan.
- To improve the app and roll out cooler tones.
- To troubleshoot issues and answer support requests.
- To follow the law, because jail time isn’t part of our roadmap.
- We do not sell or rent your data. Seriously, it’s not that interesting.

Data Storage and Retention
- Text inputs are generally processed on the fly and not stored.
- If you sign up, your account info stays until you delete it or ghost us.
- You can ask us to delete your data anytime.

Third-Party Services
- We may use third-party providers for hosting, analytics, and payments. They have their own privacy policies, but we try to only work with reputable ones (no sketchy basement operations).

Your Rights
- Depending on where you live, you might have rights to access, update, or delete your data. If you want us to delete something, just ask—we won’t make it weird.

Security
- We use reasonable measures to keep your info safe. That said, no app is 100% hack-proof, so maybe don’t paste your bank PIN here.

Changes to This Policy
- If we update this policy, we’ll post it here with a new effective date. No dramatic plot twists.
