Hello, 
Human memory's unreliable, hence this notebook;

Questions I'd like to ask ~
- The idea went along like ~ auto-intro/mentoring -> finding your cofounder -> finding your first key hires. Will the idea pivot eventually to a Job seeker's platform?
- Since proportion of people finding to join an idea is >; how are we gonna make the application tune for who's serious?
- The valuation of coffeespace? (Raised $1M)

Tech stack recommendations ~
- Golang instead of NodeJS
- Weaviate instead of Qdrant

Personal user experience ~
- I was getting recommended more from people from few startups like StealthAI, Evu.com; Even if I didn't like the recommendations. 
- After a match, the conversations dry up - as in any social media interaction between unknowns.

Suggested solutions ~
- Maybe work with filters like disliked company's to be avoided;
- Maybe having few personalised questions popped up at hover at chat window, like, "what made you switch your career at XYZ to be all in at this startup?."
