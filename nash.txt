Well, Nashrah. Read this jabhi you get time.
I was up. Thinking. Raat ko. Bad combination, i know.
Thinking about tumhara situation has gotten me wondering about all possible cases, and i think it's my duty to tell you about this possibility, which is valid.
These are just mere thoughts, could/could not be helpful for navigating into making your decision, par I can't keep it to myself. 

Sometimes, things come to us easy and we overcomplicate it. Human tendency. 
You and the 24y old dude might work out well. You guys have all the boxes checked out, he will obviously be good to you and more. I am actually too honest to admit to say ki this might be perfect for you in some sense. (I am SURE if it were someone else woh hypocrite ki tarah behave karta)

I'd like for you to know ki if you want someone to potentially be close with, I'm here. (I am not a good sales guy okay so bear with me which i do my pitch. Is it too cringe? Let me know. Never actually done this before AND textually it's hard to express).
I'm a little awkward, ambiverted guy with maybe more than avg EQ (which i am very proud of). I overthink tons but that has mostly always ended up in my favour. You kinda know about my day to day;
I play games when I am bored, have recently started to believe in adapting to good habits (like duolingo for now, i have a 44 day streak🙂) and work at this stupid lil job at this stupid lil company jo wfh nahi deti😭. Mere ambitions exceed bohot, but at the very end I'd like to own or build something on my own someday (software, tech). My passion is what i do at my job, so i am happy.
I am not that rich, I got good family which is priceless and I have not been in ANY real relationships (apart from that puppet relationship with that hindu girl and not that great Hinge dates) past mai. (Too boring i am); 
My faith's a spiral, mostly its positive. Sometimes I do have doubts, but recently I came to know ki dua's hold power, and have been embracing it bohot. I will be alright i hope.

Why the pitch? To let you know what cards you have in play. (I swear UNO ke cards would be soo much easy yaha instead). 
Oh yes, hamara ludo score is currently 23-21. You're leading. So i hate to admit ki you are slightly smarter than me. (𝘓𝘶𝘤𝘬𝘺. 𝘠𝘰𝘶'𝘳𝘦 𝘭𝘶𝘤𝘬𝘺. 😭)
Since you're smarter, and proven it to be; I know whatever you do would be the best of us.
Yes, we agreed on staying friends and I will respect it if you say so. You don't have to reply to this, Just read. 🐒
